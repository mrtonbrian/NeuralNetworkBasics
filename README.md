# NeuralNetworkBasics
## WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

Implements some (super) basic functionality of DNNs in C++ as a header library. Just meant as a place for me to experiment with the underlying concepts of DNNs! Also will include some experiments with other machine learning libaries (primarily python Tensorflow and PyTorch).

Maybe in the future I'll implement support for things like Convolutional Layers / actually use a linear algebra library (lol!). Also should probably implement L1+L2 regularization at some point.

Thanks to and [this video series by 3B1B](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) [this video by Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfMk-kjRv4c) for the basics of neural networks. And, thanks to [this article](http://www.code-spot.co.za/2009/10/08/15-steps-to-implemented-a-neural-net/) too, for a basic outline of what an DNN architecture looks like!
