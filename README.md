# NeuralNetworkBasics
## WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

Implements some (super) basic functionality of DNNs in C++ as a header library. Just meant as a place for me to experiment with the underlying concepts of DNNs! Also will some experiments with other machine learning libaries (primarily python Tensorflow and PyTorch).

Maybe in the future I'll implement support for things like Convolutional Layers / actually use a linear algebra library (lol!)

Thanks to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfMk-kjRv4c) for the basics of neural networks.
